# socket server 

The websocket server uses socket.io
Use the following code snippet to connect and to the socket server 


```javascript
const socket = io("https://lionfish-app-hsj4b.ondigitalocean.app/", {
      withCredentials: false,
      /// Pass the token you receive from our authentication server here
      extraHeaders:Â´{authorizationToken: <<YOUR TOKEN HERE >> }
      });
```
